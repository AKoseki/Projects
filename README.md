# Projects
Hello! I'm Alex Koseki. Nice to meet you!

I'm a Japanese that was born in Brazil, and now live in the UK.
I'm an experienced Developer, Devops, Engineer, having worked for over 20 years with IT.
My career has been diverse within the IT area, working with first to third level support, Infrastructure, Server installation and maintenance, Datacenter, frontend and backend development.

I also have experience as a Business Analyst, where I identified areas for improvement within the company and gained a commercial perspective on the business.
On that same company, as a result of my high performance, I was promoted to Software Analyst, where my proactive approach led to significant achievements, such as preventing a bottleneck during Black Friday on an e-commerce website by scaling servers and identifying a critical bug, which I fixed and deployed before the event.

My previous roles required working in high-throughput environments where optimized code, documentation, quality, and testing were crucial. I am well-versed in Kanban, Agile, and CI/CD methodologies.

I've got exceptional ability to quickly adapt to new environments, understand company requirements, and efficiently integrate into existing codebases. I am confident in my ability to tackle tasks independently, given the codebase and necessary documentation.


This page is a hub for my Projects, a bit about me, as well as hosting some files.

Currently there isn't much, but I plan to add a lot more here.
